# FinancePro - CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Project Overview
FinancePro is a global leading Banking and Financial services provider based out of Germany. The company offers products and services such as:
- Banking
- Funds Management
- Loans
- Debit Cards and Credit Cards
- Investment Banking

### Problem Statement
Initially, FinancePro operated using a monolithic application architecture. As the business grew, the company began facing significant challenges in:
- Managing the application infrastructure
- Deployment complexities
- Difficulty scaling the application during increased traffic loads

### Solution
To overcome these issues, FinancePro decided to migrate to a **microservices architecture** and adopt **DevOps practices** with automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. AWS was chosen as the primary cloud provider for infrastructure provisioning and application deployment.

## Project Goals
- Deliver frequent product updates to production automatically
- Ensure high quality and reliability of deployments
- Accelerate software delivery speed
- Improve feedback time between developers and testers

## Tools & Technologies Used
This project uses the following tools to implement end-to-end CI/CD and monitoring:

| Tool         | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Git**      | Version control system for tracking code changes                        |
| **Maven**    | Continuous build tool for managing dependencies and building the code  |
| **Jenkins**  | Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment automation            |
| **Docker**   | Containerization of microservices for consistent deployment environments |
| **Ansible**  | Configuration management and environment setup automation              |
| **Terraform**| Infrastructure provisioning on AWS                                      |
| **Prometheus**| Monitoring system for real-time infrastructure and application health   |
| **Grafana**  | Visualization and reporting of metrics collected by Prometheus         |

## Key Benefits
- **Automated Infrastructure Creation**: Using Terraform for provisioning AWS resources
- **Continuous Build and Test**: Maven and Jenkins ensure every code change is built and tested automatically
- **Automated Deployments**: Jenkins pipelines deploy containerized applications via Docker to AWS
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible manages consistent server setups and deployments
- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Prometheus gathers metrics, and Grafana visualizes system health and performance reports

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate Slack notifications for deployment and monitoring alerts
- Implement Blue-Green deployment strategy for zero downtime releases
- Add SonarQube for continuous code quality checks
